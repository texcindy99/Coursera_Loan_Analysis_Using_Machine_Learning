## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This is a Coursera machine learning project. I was interestested in using load data to classify load borrower using four classification methods:

1. K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
2. Decision Tree
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Logistic Regression

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There are two data files used in the notebook. "load_train.csv" is the training data file and "load_test.csv" is the test data file.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code is that decision tree has the highest F1-score around 0.80 and all the other three methods have F1-score at 0.74 on test data set.   

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Coursera for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the link available [here](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
